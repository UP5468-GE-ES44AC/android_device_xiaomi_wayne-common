    <!-- Array of light sensor LUX values to define our levels for auto backlight brightness support.
         The N entries of this array define N + 1 control points as follows:
         (1-based arrays)
         Point 1: (0, value[1]): lux <= 0
         Point 2: (level[1], value[2]): 0 < lux <= level[1]
         Point 3: (level[2], value[3]): level[2] < lux <= level[3]
         ...
         Point N+1: (level[N], value[N+1]): level[N] < lux
         The control points must be strictly increasing.  Each control point
         corresponds to an entry in the brightness backlight values arrays.
         For example, if LUX == level[1] (first element of the levels array)
         then the brightness will be determined by value[2] (second element
         of the brightness values array).
         Spline interpolation is used to determine the auto-brightness
         backlight values for LUX levels between these control points.
         Must be overridden in platform specific overlays -->


    <!-- Array of output values for LCD backlight corresponding to the LUX values
         in the config_autoBrightnessLevels array.  This array should have size one greater
         than the size of the config_autoBrightnessLevels array.
         The brightness values must be between 0 and 255 and be non-decreasing.
         This must be overridden in platform specific overlays -->
    

    <!-- Screen brightness used to dim the screen when the user activity

    <!-- Minimum screen brightness setting allowed by the power manager.
         The user is forbidden from setting the brightness below this level. -->


    <!-- Stability requirements in milliseconds for accepting a new brightness level.  This is used
         for debouncing the light sensor.  Different constants are used to debounce the light sensor
         when adapting to brighter or darker environments.  This parameter controls how quickly
         brightness changes occur in response to an observed change in light level that exceeds the
         hysteresis threshold. -->

    <!-- Whether WiFi display is supported by this device.
         There are many prerequisites for this feature to work correctly.
         Here are a few of them:
         * The WiFi radio must support WiFi P2P.
         * The WiFi radio must support concurrent connections to the WiFi display and
           to an access point.
         * The Audio Flinger audio_policy.conf file must specify a rule for the "r_submix"
           remote submix module.  This module is used to record and stream system
           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.
         * The remote submix module "audio.r_submix.default" must be installed on the device.
         * The device must be provisioned with HDCP keys (for protected content).

    <!-- Power Management: Specifies whether to decouple the auto-suspend state of the
         device from the display on/off state.
         When false, autosuspend_disable() will be called before the display is turned on
         and autosuspend_enable() will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices using legacy power management
         features such as early suspend / late resume.
         When true, autosuspend_display() and autosuspend_enable() will be called
         independently of whether the display is being turned on or off.  This mode
         enables the power manager to suspend the application processor while the
         display is on.
         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.
         Refer to autosuspend.h for details.
